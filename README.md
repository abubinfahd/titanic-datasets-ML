# titanic-datasets-ML

I was too much excited to learn Machine Learning. But I couldn't decide where I should start learning. Then I found Rakib Sir( Founder of a YT Channel "রকিবের সাথে কৃত্তিম
বুদ্ধিমত্তা"। I learned a basic data exploratory analysis, how to make an ML model, the fundamental concept of Data Visualization, Feature Engineering, Decision Tree, Random Forest & also some important packages in R.This help me a lot to start my Data Science journey.
I submitted my prediction in Kaggle. My accuracy is 78.577%.
